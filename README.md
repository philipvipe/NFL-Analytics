A walkthrough of the data science pipeline using NFL draft data!

This walkthrough includes the following:
  1. **Data Collection**: We scrape historical draft data from Pro-Football Reference
  2. **Data Processing and Preperation**: We tidy the data so we can visualize and create our ML models in the following steps
  3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We visualize the data to see trends in average player value accumulated in the draft over time for different positions and teams
  4. **Machine Learning**: We train and test a machine learning model using the data we collected in step 1 to predict the 2020 NFL Rookie Offensive MVP!
